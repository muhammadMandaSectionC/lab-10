In crafting my website, I aimed for a minimalist vibe, focusing on simplicity and sophistication
To ensure my website looks great on all devices, I incorporated Bootstrap's grid system for responsive layout design. I made sure content adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. my navigation bar collapses neatly into a hamburger menu on smaller screens, enhancing usability. 
faced some hurdles aligning our custom styling with Bootstrap's default styles, requiring careful adjustments for consistency. Ensuring images scaled well across devices and customizing the navigation bar while maintaining responsiveness required thorough testing and tweaking. Additionally, achieving cross-browser compatibility through testing and troubleshooting.
